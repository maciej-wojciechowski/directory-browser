# Dependecies
 
 ## Axios
 I have used axios for http requests. It have let me create default settings for API used in this project and saved me some boilerplate code.

 ## Styled-components
 It is very handy way for writing CSS in JS, and it let me create very quickly styles for this application. It also let me create styles based on props passed to the components.
